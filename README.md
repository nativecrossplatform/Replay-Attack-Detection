Replay Attack Detection
This project focuses on enhancing the security of biometric systems utilizing voice recognition by detecting and preventing replay attacks.

Replay attacks occur when a malicious actor attempts to bypass authentication by playing a pre-recorded voice sample. This project implements advanced techniques to identify and mitigate such threats, ensuring the integrity and reliability of voice-based biometric systems.
